## What is Mockgoose?

Mockgoose provides test database by spinning up mongod on the back when mongoose.connect call is made. By default it is using in memory store which does not have persistence.

## Install
To install the latest official version, use NPM:

    npm install mockgoose --save-dev


## Usage
You simply require Mongoose and Mockgoose and wrap Mongoose with Mockgoose.
```javascript
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var mockgoose = require('mockgoose');

mockgoose(mongoose).then(function() {
	// mongoose connection		
});
```
Once Mongoose has been wrapped by Mockgoose connect() will be intercepted by Mockgoose so that no MongoDB instance is created.

## Mocha

```javascript
var Mongoose = require('mongoose').Mongoose;
var mongoose = new Mongoose();

var mockgoose = require('mockgoose');

before(function(done) {
	mockgoose(mongoose).then(function() {
		mongoose.connect('mongodb://example.com/TestingDB', function(err) {
			done(err);
		});
	});
});

describe('...', function() {
	it("...", function(done) {
		// ...
		done();
	});
});
```

## Helper methods and variables

### reset(callback)
Reset method will remove **ALL** of the collections from a temporary store,
note that this method is part of **mockgoose** object, and not defined under
**mongoose**

```javascript
mockgoose.reset(function() {
	done()
});
```

### isMocked
Returns **TRUE** from **mongoose** object if Mockgoose is applied

```javascript
if ( mongoose.isMocked === true ) {
  // mongoose object is mocked
}
```

## unmock(callback)
Method that can be applied on **mongoose** to remove modifications added
by **mockgoose**, it will perform disconnect on temporary store that was
created, and **will not reconnect**

## unmockAndReconnect(callback)
Same as **unmock**, however it will reconnect to original URI that was
passed during **connect**
