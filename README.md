##What is Mockgoose?

Mockgoose is a simplified in memory database that allows you to perform actions on Mongoose Models without having a running instance of MongoDB. 

The main purpose of Mockgoose as you may have guessed from the name is to allow you to mock out your mongoose database during testing so that you do not have to spin up a new database for every test and teardown that same database afterwards.

##Install
To install the latest official version, use NPM:

    npm install mockgoose --save-dev

To run the tests and see what is supported by Mockgoose navigate to the Mockgoose folder and run the test suite

    npm test

##Usage
You simply require Mongoose and Mockgoose and wrap Mongoose with Mockgoose.

    var mongoose = require('mongoose');
    var mockgoose = require('Mockgoose');

    mockgoose(mongoose);

Once Mongoose has been wrapped by Mockgoose all calls to connect() and createConnection() will be intercepted by Mockgoose so that no MongoDB instance is created.

Currently supported model operations are.

    save();
    create();
    remove();
    count();
    find();
    findById();
    findByIdAndRemove();
    findByIdAndUpdate();
    findOne();
    findOneAndRemove();
    findOneAndUpdate();
    Update();

##Operators

    $in
    $inc
    $pull
    $pullAll
    $push + $each
    $pushAll
    $addToSet + $each
    $set

##Options

    multi   : 0/1 defaults to 0
    upsert  : true/false defaults to false
    sort    : one level of sorting for find operations {sort: {name:1}}

##Validators
Mockgoose includes support for validators and the unique field key.

Mockgoose comes with a reset() method that allows you to reset the Mockgoose database
simply call 

    mockgoose.reset() 

to delete all the collections and models in the database
or call 
    
    mockgoose.reset('schema name') 

to delete all the associated models for a schema.

            }
        }
    }

    Model.find({'user.profile.name' : 'john'}).exec();

###1.0.0
Complete rewrite to implement a mock driver for mongodb instead of returning mock models. 

###0.2.7
Fixed connect/createConnection issue where connect was delegating to createConnection instead of returning
the first mongoose connection.


###0.2.6
Made model names case insensitive 'SimpleModel' and 'simplemodel' are now classed as the same model.

###0.2.5
Added sort to find operations.
Fixed an issue with calling mongoose.model('modelName') without a schema that
was returning a real Mongoose Model it now correctly returns a Mocked Mongoose Model.
Fixed count() so that you do not need to pass a query as the first param

###0.2.4
Aligned Mockgoose.connect() and Mockgoose.createConnection() with the Mongoose API.
You can now pass host, database, port, options, callback to the connections in the same manner as
mongoose http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#connection_Connection.

The only options value that will be used is the db value all other options will be ignored.
